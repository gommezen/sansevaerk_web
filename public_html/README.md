# public_html

Mirror of the public web root for sansevaerk.dk.

This folder contains:
- HTML pages
- frontend JavaScript and CSS
- API endpoints under /api/

All files here are directly or indirectly accessible from the browser.

API scripts may include PHP files from ../private_journal/.
No other backend logic should live here.
